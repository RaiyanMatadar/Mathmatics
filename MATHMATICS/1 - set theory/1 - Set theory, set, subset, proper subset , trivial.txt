1.1 Set theory, set, subset, proper subset , trivial 

------------------------------------------------

Set: A well-defined unordered collection of distinct elements is called a set.

• Unordered collection •
A = {1,2,3,4}
B = {2,3,4,1}
So do you think these 2 sets are different or same? The answer is: they are the same because the order doesn't matter. That’s why it is called an unordered collection.

• Distinct elements •
C = {11,22,33,4}
So do you think set C is same as set A or B? The answer is: yes, it's still valid because all elements are distinct.

------------------------------------------------

Null set / Empty set: A set with no elements is called a null set or empty set.

It is denoted as Φ (phi) or {}

• Null set •
A = Φ → This means set A is empty.

• Empty set •
B = {} → This also means set B is empty.

But what if the set is like this:
C = {Φ}
This is NOT an empty set. It is a set that contains one element, which is the null set (Φ). So this is called a set containing null element.

------------------------------------------------

Subset: If every element of set A is also present in set B, then A is a subset of B.

Example:
A = {1,2,3,4}
B = {1,2,3,4,5}
So A ⊆ B

C = {1,2}
So C ⊆ A

• Trivial subset •
Every set is a subset of itself: A ⊆ A

Also, the null set (Φ) is a subset of every set.

Why? Because there are no elements in Φ to violate the rule.

Example:
Is Φ a subset of A = {1,2,3,4}?
Yes, because there is nothing in Φ to test, so it's always true.

------------------------------------------------

Proper subset: Any subset of a set A that is NOT equal to A is called a proper subset of A.

Proper subset symbol: ⊂

Example:
A = {1,2}
B = {1,2,3}
✔ A ⊂ B → A is a proper subset of B

A = {1,2,3}
B = {1,2,3}
❌ A ⊂ B → Not a proper subset, because both are equal.

------------------------------------------------

Cardinality: The number of elements in a set is called the cardinality.

Example:
A = {1,2,3,4}
Cardinality of A = 4
