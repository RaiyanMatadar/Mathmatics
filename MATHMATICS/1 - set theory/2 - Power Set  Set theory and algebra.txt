1.2 Power Set | Set theory and algebra

Power set: If A is a finite set, then the set of all subsets of A is called the power set of A.

It includes:
- Empty set (∅)
- All subsets
- The set itself

Formula:
If a set has n elements, then its power set has 2ⁿ subsets.

Example:
A = {a, b}
Power Set = {∅, {a}, {b}, {a, b}}

Real Life Uses:
- Outfit combinations
- Product bundles
- Packing options
- Testing feature sets

⚠ Notes:
- No duplicates
- Order doesn’t matter
- Empty set is always included
