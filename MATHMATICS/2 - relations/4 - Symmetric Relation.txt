symmetric relation : a relation on a set "A" is said to be 
symmetric relation if xRy then yRx ∀ x,y ∈ A
i.g = if (x,y) ∈ R then (y,x)∈ R ∀ (x,y) ∈ A

A = {1,2,3,4}
R = {(1,2)(1,3)(2,1)(2,2)(3,1)}
R = {}

this simply means if an R has (1,2) then it must also have
(2,1) so then it becomes an symmetric relation right then there is
another condition where if an R has (2,2) so is this an symmetric relation
then it means yes cause there are by default same. and if an R is an {} null/empty
value in it then will it be symmetric relation then the asnwer is yes it is symmetric 
relation cause it has no (x,y) value in it thats why there will be on (y,x) thats why
