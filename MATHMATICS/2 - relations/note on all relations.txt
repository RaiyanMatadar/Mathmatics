small note on relations 
in the reflexive relation case we should see the set elements becuase its says that 
we must need all the elements reflexive 

in other cases we can directly see the R for irreflexive,symmetric,asymettric,antisymmetric 
we can skip to see the set like we can direclty see R instead of set.
