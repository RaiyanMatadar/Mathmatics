cartesion product : 
let A = {a,b}     B = {1,2,3}

we define cartesian products = A × B

how does it works?
so we have two sets one A and B so to get the cartesian products of it we 
define it like A × B this so which means take set A first element then multiply 
it with set B let me show you how 

explaination

right way 
A × B = {(a,1),(a,2),(a,3),(b,1),(b,2),(b,3)} 

wrong ways 
A × B = {(1,a),(2,a),(3,a),(1,b),(2,b),(3,b)}
this way is wrong till you define the cartesion product reverse like B × A if you 
define the cartesian as this then that gonna be correct way

remember the point that A x B is not equal to B x A 
(A × B ≠ B × A) 

they can be equal if the set element are same as followed 
A = {1,2}    
B = {1,2}    
so in this scenario the A x B = B x A 



also remeber that if an set conatines Φ then it will also included in the cross element let me show you how 
A = {Φ,1,2}
B = {Φ,1,2}

so the out put would be 
A x B = {(Φ,Φ),(Φ,1),(Φ,2),(1,Φ),(1,1),(1,2),(2,Φ),(2,1),(2,2)}

so you might be thinking if there are more element in the set the how you gonna get the total elements total
so for example 

A = {1,2,3,4,5,6,9,8} (total cardinality of A is 8)
B = {1,2,4,9,8,7,6,5,4} (total cardinality of B is 9)
so we do multiplication = 8 * 9 = 72 
so the total set of the cartesion would be 72

Relation in Cartesian Product:
A relation is just a selection of some pairs from the Cartesian product A × B.

Example:

Let:
A = {1, 2}
B = {a, b}

Then:
A × B = {(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)}

A relation from A to B can be:
R = {(1, a), (2, b)}

That’s a relation — just a part of A × B.

Final line:
Relation ⟶ a subset of A × B
