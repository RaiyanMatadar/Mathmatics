antisymmetric relation = a relation "R" is said to be antisymmetric
if xRy and yRx then x = y ∀ x,y ∈ A
i.e = if (x,y) ∈ R then (y,x) ∈ R only if x = y ∀ x,y ∈ A

A = 1,2,3
R = {(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)} an antisymmetric relation
R = {} an antisymmetric relation 
R = {(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)(2,1)} an antisymmetric relation
R = {(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(2,1),(1,2)} not an antisymmetric relation

An antisymmetric relation is one in which, if both (x, y) and (y, x) are present, then x must be equal to y.
So, if all the pairs in the relation have x = y (like (1,1), (2,2), etc.), then it is antisymmetric.
If the relation contains a pair like (1,2) alone, it's still antisymmetric as long as (2,1) is not present.
However, if both (x, y) and (y, x) exist in the relation and x ≠ y, then it is not antisymmetric.
Also, an empty or null relation is always considered antisymmetric, because there are no pairs that violate the condition.
