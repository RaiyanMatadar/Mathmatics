irreflexive relation : A relation R on a set "A" is said to be irreflexive if 
x does not belong to x {x is not related to x} ∀x ∈ A 
i.e (x,x) ∈ R 


exmaple 
A = {1,2,3}

A x A = {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)} 
	{(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)}
	{(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)}

so for making an irreflexive relation we must not use the same element of the given cardination product 
as (1,1) (2,2) (3,3)

some examples 
R = {(1,1),(1,2)} this is called an irreflexive relation cause there is an single element of same pair as (1,1)

some confusions happpen as followed
if an set is not an reflexive relation then would we consider it irreflexive relation?
no we dont call it irreflexive 
example 
R = {(1,1),(2,2)} 
is this an reflexive relation ?
no its not so in this condition this is not an reflexive relation nighter it is irreflexive relation 

if the questions say make the smallest relation then what you gonna do?
remeber Φ and {} is an trivial of every set so you can just say
R = {Φ} 
or
R = {}  (but this one we can call it irreflexive relation as well cause we are following the condition of the irreflexive relation)

how many element of irreflexive can come ?
A = {1,2,3}

A x A = {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)} 
	{(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)}
	{(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)}

so here just take out the diagonal pair which is (1,1)(2,2)(3,3) then the leftover one would be the total element of irreflexive relation
so total number of irreflexive relation is 2^(n^2 - n)
