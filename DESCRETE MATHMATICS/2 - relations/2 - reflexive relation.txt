reflexive relation : a relation "R" on a set "A" is said to be reflexive 
If (𝑥,𝑥) ∈ 𝑅 for every 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 x ∈ A

simple analogy = if every element of set A is related to it self then 
it is called a reflaxive relation

A = {1,2,3}

A x A = {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)}
	{(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)}
	{(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)}

so you might be thinking if we want to make an reflexive relation then what 
do we do so in this case we select the element which is related to itself means 
R = {(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)} so to make an reflexive relation we must use all the same 
element in the pair

quick quiz 
R1 = {(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)} so this is called reflexive relation
R2 = {(1,1),(2,2)}       so is this an also reflaxive relation 
uhmm nope because for every x belong to x 

R3 = {(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(1,2)} yes it is reflactive relation becuse every element of 
x in belongs to x and if the element more after the x belong to x its fine cause its 
followed the formula
