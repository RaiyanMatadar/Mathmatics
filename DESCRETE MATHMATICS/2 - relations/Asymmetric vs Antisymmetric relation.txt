Asymmetric relation : a relation "R" is said to be asymmetric 
if xRy and yRnotx then x = y ∀ x,y ∈ A
i.g = if (x,y) ∈ R then (y,x) ∉ R ∀ x,y ∉ A

A = {1,2,3} not
R1 = {(1,2),(1,3),(1,1)} not 
R2 = {(1,2),(1,3),(2,3)} Asymmetric relation

An asymmetric relation is one in which if (x, y) is in the relation, then (y, x) must not be in the relation — even if x = y.
So, no pair (x, x) is allowed in an asymmetric relation.
If any pair like (x, x) exists, or if both (x, y) and (y, x) are present, it is not asymmetric.
An empty or null relation is always considered asymmetric, since it doesn't violate the condition.

quick examples of it 
every asymettric is an antisymmetric
